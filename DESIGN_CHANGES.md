# TomorrowRank — Design Update (Welcome Tomorrow dark theme)

This update replaces the old white/yellow entry design with the Welcome Tomorrow
dark hero look (warped green grid + edge glow), applied across the whole app:
the entry screen, the running-audit screen, and the results report.

## What changed
- **components/Background.tsx** (new) — fixed full-viewport canvas: pure-black base,
  warped "gravity-well" grid mesh (SVG feDisplacementMap) and olive-green light
  bleeding from the edges. Mounted once in `app/layout.tsx`, so it sits behind every
  page automatically.
- **app/layout.tsx** — mounts `<Background />`; body is now black with white text.
- **app/globals.css** — black canvas, dark form controls, dark scrollbar, green
  progress halo. The old hand-drawn underline was removed.
- **tailwind.config.ts** — new dark/green token set:
  - `wtgreen` #4CA66B (CTA, sampled from the brand screenshot)
  - `wtgreenDeep` #3E9059 (hover)
  - `wtglow` #9BC846 (edge glow / accents)
  - `glass` / `glassStrong` / `glassBorder` (translucent panels)
  - `muted` #B9C2BC (body text on dark)
- **app/page.tsx** — transparent nav over the canvas; the ☀ + text wordmark was
  replaced with the provided Welcome Tomorrow logo, recolored white so it reads on
  black (`public/welcome-tomorrow-logo.png`).
- **components/AuditApp.tsx** — heading "SEO Audit & AI Visibility Tool" is now white
  with no underline; "AUDIT →" button uses the brand green; inputs/selects and the
  processing screen are dark glass with green accents.
- **components/Report.tsx**, **Primitives.tsx**, **AiVisibility.tsx** — all cards are
  dark "glass" panels so the warped background shows through; gauges/charts use a
  green-led palette on dark.
- **public/welcome-tomorrow-logo.png** (new) — your supplied logo, inverted to white.

## Notes
- The logo is your exact artwork, inverted to white so it shows on the black bar.
- `next build` succeeds and all pages render (verified in a headless browser).
- A build-time warning about fetching `fonts.googleapis.com` only appears in network-
  restricted sandboxes; it is harmless and does not occur on Vercel.

## Update 2 — Audit reliability + diagnostics

Fixes the "Unexpected end of JSON input" runtime error (a server crash that returned
an empty body) and makes deploy issues self-diagnosing.

- **lib/store/jobs.ts** — Upstash read/write wrapped in try/catch with clear,
  actionable error messages; added `isRedisConfigured()` and `pingStore()` for health.
- **app/api/audit/start/route.ts** — whole handler wrapped in try/catch so it ALWAYS
  returns JSON (never an empty 500); returns a clear message when Upstash isn't set;
  background worker now triggered via Vercel `waitUntil` for reliable delivery.
- **app/api/audit/run/route.ts** — returns immediately and runs the audit under
  `waitUntil`; catches pipeline errors and records them on the job.
- **app/api/audit/health/route.ts** (new) — `GET /api/audit/health` reports which env
  vars are present (booleans only) and whether Redis is actually reachable.
- **components/AuditApp.tsx** — robust response parsing surfaces the real server error
  instead of "Unexpected end of JSON input"; status polling handles failures gracefully.
- **package.json** — added `@vercel/functions` (for `waitUntil`).

See DEPLOYMENT.md for the full env-var checklist and the health-check workflow.
